  { "question": "Will AVIF work on all browsers?", "answer": "AVIF is supported by modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge). Provide WebP or JPG fallbacks for older versions." },
  { "question": "How much smaller are AVIF files vs WebP?", "answer": "Results vary by image, but AVIF is often 15–30% smaller at similar visual quality." },
  { "question": "Does it keep transparency?", "answer": "Yes. If your WebP has an alpha channel, the AVIF output preserves it." },
