      "title": "What is HEIC?"

      "description": "<p>HEIC is a file extension for images stored using the HEIF (High Efficiency Image File Format) standard — commonly encoded with HEVC (H.265). It offers strong compression with good quality but isn't universally supported.</p>"

    }
    {
      "title": "What is JPG?"

      "description": "<p>JPG (JPEG) is the most widely supported image format. It uses lossy compression to balance quality and size, which makes it ideal for sharing and web use.</p>"

      "title": "Troubleshooting"

      "description": "<ul><li><strong>Upload fails:</strong> Ensure the file is HEIC/HEIF and ≤ 16&nbsp;MB.</li><li><strong>Rotated image:</strong> Some viewers ignore EXIF orientation — rotate after download if needed.</li><li><strong>Color shift:</strong> Wide-gamut photos may look different; convert with sRGB if required.</li><li><strong>Live Photos:</strong> Only the still HEIC is converted; the paired video (MOV) isn't included.</li></ul>"

  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Is this HEIC to JPG converter free?"

      "answer": "Yes, the converter is completely free with no hidden charges or subscriptions."

    }
    {
      "question": "Will I lose quality when converting HEIC to JPG?"

      "answer": "JPG uses lossy compression, so a small quality loss is possible. We use tuned settings (quality ~90, progressive) to keep it minimal."

    }
    {
      "question": "Which devices support HEIC?"

      "answer": "HEIC/HEIF is common on Apple devices. Many other platforms still prefer JPG by default."

    }
    {
      "question": "What file sizes are supported?"

      "answer": "You can upload images up to 16&nbsp;MB per file."

    }
    {
      "question": "Are my files safe?"

      "answer": "Files are processed automatically and not retained longer than necessary for conversion."

    }
    {
      "question": "Can I convert multiple HEIC files at once?"

      "answer": "This page converts one file at a time. For bulk needs, repeat the process or use a batch tool."

    }
    {
      "question": "When should I use JPG instead of HEIC?"

      "answer": "Use JPG for maximum compatibility, uploads to platforms that don't support HEIC, or when sharing with non-Apple devices."

    }
  ]
  "note": "JPG uses lossy compression; slight size/quality trade-offs are normal. For transparency needs, convert HEIC to PNG instead."
