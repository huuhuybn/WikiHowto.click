  "description": "<p>A file converter changes a file’s format to improve <strong>compatibility</strong>, <strong>quality</strong>, or <strong>size</strong>. Common examples include converting images for the web (<em>PNG → WebP</em>), preparing print-ready documents (<em>JPG/PNG → PDF</em>), or extracting visuals from documents (<em>PDF → JPG/PNG/TIFF/WebP</em>).</p><p>Good converters balance quality and size, preserve transparency where applicable (PNG/WebP), and keep layout for PDFs (page size, margins, fit-to-page). Our tools expose sensible defaults so most users can convert in seconds.</p>"

  "description": "<ul><li><strong>Lossy vs. Lossless:</strong> JPG/WebP (lossy) shrink size by discarding some data; PNG/TIFF (lossless) keep full detail. Choose lossy for web sharing, lossless for editing/archival.</li><li><strong>Raster vs. Vector:</strong> JPG/PNG/WebP/TIFF are raster (pixels). SVG/AI are vector (shapes, paths). Raster needs adequate resolution (DPI) for print; vector scales infinitely without blur.</li><li><strong>Color & Metadata:</strong> Conversions can affect ICC profiles, EXIF, or alpha channels. Our image-to-PDF tools preserve transparency behavior appropriately and fit images to page with margins for predictable print.</li></ul>"

    { "question": "What is a file converter?", "answer": "It changes a file from one format to another (e.g., JPG → PNG, PDF → JPG) to improve compatibility, quality, or size." },
  { "question": "Which converters are most popular?", "answer": "PDF ↔ Image (PDF → JPG/PNG/WebP/TIFF and JPG/PNG/WebP/TIFF → PDF) and Image ↔ Image (JPG ↔ PNG, PNG ↔ WebP) are the most used." },
  { "question": "Do you compress images?", "answer": "Yes, lossy formats like JPG/WebP reduce size with adjustable quality; lossless formats like PNG/TIFF preserve detail." },
  { "question": "Do you preserve transparency?", "answer": "PNG and WebP support alpha channels. When converting to PDF, pages are laid out with margins and fit-to-page behavior for predictable output." },
  { "question": "Is OCR supported?", "answer": "OCR is not enabled by default. For text extraction from images/PDFs, use dedicated OCR tools." },
  { "question": "Maximum file size?", "answer": "Most converters support up to 100MB per conversion. For larger files, split or compress first." },
  { "question": "Are my files stored?", "answer": "No. Files are processed securely and auto-deleted after conversion." },
  { "question": "Can I batch-convert or merge?", "answer": "Many tools support multi-file upload and merging (e.g., Merge JPG → PDF, Combine PNG → PDF)." }
